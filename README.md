Welcome Professor Hugo!

In this project we will be talking about the OpenRA Game Engine, how it was designed and its architecture. The OpenRA project involves a lot more than just the OpenRA Game Engine, but for the purpose of the work developed, this will be our main focus.

#[Analysis and Overview](https://github.com/Malafas/OpenRA/blob/bleed/ADS/ANALYSIS.md)
In order to be able to understand how this system works and what patterns and styles have been used during its development, we will first be doing a quick analysis and overview of the systems features and project structure.

#[Architecture]()

This system's architectural analysis will be based on three main aspects:
* It's [**architectural patterns**](https://github.com/Malafas/OpenRA/blob/bleed/ADS/ARCHITECTURE.md);
* It's [**architectural styles**](https://github.com/Malafas/OpenRA/blob/bleed/ADS/STYLE.md);
* The systems [**"4 + 1" view model**](https://github.com/Malafas/OpenRA/blob/bleed/ADS/4+1/4+1.md), which describes its developments, logical, physical and processes views; as well as its scenarios.

#[Design]()

Finally, the main design aspect that will be evaluated in this project, is going to be its [**design patterns**](https://github.com/Malafas/OpenRA/blob/bleed/ADS/DESIGN.md)
