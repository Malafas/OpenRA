####Main Program/Subroutines

The AI's progress symbolizes the ideal one to how the user should conduct his own and it is founded on base setting, aquiring resources, constructing new buildings and producing combat units assumes a style in the image of batch sequential. 
All begins with setting up a main structure, slowly at the start, you can unblock tiers of more complicated ones, each of them unblocking other options. Sometimes new features become available with combinations of aquired structures.

Each actor has a set of abilities and features which delimits the spectrum of his usage, and
