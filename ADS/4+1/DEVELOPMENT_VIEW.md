The development/implementation view illustrates a system from a programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management.
The OpenRA project has a big set of packages in its scope, but in regards to the Game Engine in itself, the only package that we took into consideration was the "OpenRA.Game" given the fact that engine's logic resides in it.
